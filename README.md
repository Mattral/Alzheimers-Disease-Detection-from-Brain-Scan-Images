# Early Detection and Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease through Brain Scan Analysis
​
<Small summary of the project>

# Background

Brain-related disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, are a growing global concern. As per the World Health Organization, neurological disorders are responsible for 9% of all deaths globally, and Alzheimer’s and other dementias alone are among the top ten leading causes of death worldwide.

With a rapidly aging population, these numbers are expected to rise significantly over the coming years. Despite significant advances in medical technology, early detection and accurate diagnosis of these conditions remain challenging. Traditionally, the diagnosis of these disorders has been based on clinical assessments and symptoms. However, these methods are often subjective and may not detect the disease until it has significantly progressed.



# Problem

The goal of this project is to leverage the power of artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning and computer vision techniques, to analyze brain scan images for the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis.

Our aim is to create an AI model that can analyze these images, identify patterns that may be indicative of these disorders, and make predictions with high accuracy. The expectation is that such a tool could supplement existing diagnostic practices, providing a more objective and potentially earlier indication of these diseases. We believe that an accurate and efficient AI diagnostic tool can significantly improve the prognosis and quality of life for millions of patients globally.

## Contribution Guidelines
​
- Have a Look at the project structure and folder overview below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : *task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)* ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your File names(jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
